# **Mental Health Detection from Social Media Text (FYP-1)**

**Final Year Project – I (FYP-1)**
*Detection of Depression and Suicidal Tendencies from Social Media Text using Classical Machine Learning*

---

## **📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on detecting **mental health conditions**, specifically **Depression** and **Suicidal Ideation**, from social media text data. The aim of FYP-1 was to deeply understand and implement the **fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning** by building models **from scratch**, rather than relying on pre-built implementations from libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch**.

All preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning models were manually coded to demonstrate a strong conceptual grasp of how these systems work internally.

## **📚 Folder Description**

### **Depression/**

This folder contains all notebooks and scripts related to **depression detection** from text data. The workflow includes:

* Loading and exploring raw social media datasets
* Custom **data cleaning techniques** tailored specifically for depression-related language
* Text preprocessing (tokenization, normalization, noise removal, etc.)
* Feature extraction methods such as Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF
* Training classical machine learning models **implemented from scratch**
* Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics

---

### **Suicide/**

This folder focuses on **suicidal ideation detection**, which required a **different preprocessing and data-cleaning strategy** due to the sensitive and distinct linguistic patterns present in suicide-related text. It includes:

* Separate data cleaning pipelines from the depression dataset
* Context-aware preprocessing methods
* Custom feature engineering
* Machine learning model implementations written manually
* Performance evaluation and analysis

> **Important:**
> Depression and suicide detection were handled using **different data cleaning and preprocessing approaches**, recognizing that both problems have unique linguistic characteristics.

## **🤖 AI Usage Disclaimer**

AI chatbots were used **only as supportive tools** for guidance, clarification, and documentation assistance.
The **entire implementation, logic, and modeling were manually developed** by the project team, and no AI-generated code was directly relied upon.
